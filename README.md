# DAN-BPE

## Overview

The main goal of this assignment is to gain experience in training neural networks for text tasks, focusing on the standard NLP pipeline: reading in data, preprocessing, training, and testing. You will also explore sub-word tokenization and work on conceptual exercises to better understand the skip-gram word embedding algorithm.

## Preliminaries

### Software Requirements

This assignment will be implemented in Python 3.6 or later. We will be using PyTorch, a Python-based machine learning framework.

**Setting Up PyTorch:** To install PyTorch, follow the instructions at [PyTorch Installation Guide](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). This assignment can be completed using CPU only, so GPU support is not required.

### Creating a Virtual Environment

It is recommended (but not required) to work within a virtual environment for better dependency management. To create a new virtual environment with Python 3, run:

```bash
conda create -n my-virtenv python=3
